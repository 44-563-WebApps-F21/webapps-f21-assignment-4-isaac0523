            SCENE.--_99 Rue Tchernavaya, Moscow. A large garret lit by oil lamps
hung from ceiling. Some masked men standing silent and apart from one
another. A man in a scarlet mask is writing at a table. Door at back.
Man in yellow with drawn sword at it. Knocks heard. Figures in cloaks
and masks enter._
        </h6>

          <h5>MICH.</h5>
          <p>
            I think little of pen and ink in revolutions. One dagger will do
            more than a hundred epigrams. Still, let us read this scholar's last
            production. Give it to me. I will read it myself.
          </p> 

<h5>PROF.</h5> 
<p>Brother, you never mind your stops; let Alexis read it.</p>

<h5>MICH.</h5>
<p>Ay! he is as tripping of speech as if he were some young
    aristocrat; but for my own part I care not for the stops so that the
    sense be plain.</p> 

<h5>ALEX.</h5> 
<p>(_reading_). "The past has belonged to the tyrant, and he has
    defiled it; ours is the future, and we shall make it holy." Ay! let us
    make the future holy; let there be one revolution at least which is not
    bred in crime, nurtured in murder!</p>

<h5>MICH.</h5>
<p> They have spoken to us by the sword, and by the sword we shall
    answer! You are too delicate for us, Alexis. There should be none here
    but men whose hands are rough with labour or red with blood.</p>

<h5>PRES.</h5>
<p>Peace, Michael, peace! He is the bravest heart among us.</p> 

<h5>MICH.</h5> 
<p>(_aside_). He will need to be brave to-night.</p>

<p>(_The sound of sleigh bells is heard outside._)</p>

<p>VOICE (_outside_). Per crucem ad lucem.</p>

<P>_Answer of man on guard._ Per sanguinem ad libertatem.</P>

<h5>MICH.</h5> <p>Who is that?
</p>
<h5>VERA.</h5> <p>God save the people!</p>

<h5>PRES.</h5> <p>Welcome, Vera, welcome! [6]We have been sick at heart till we saw
    you; but now methinks the star of freedom has come to wake us from the
    night.[6]</p>

<h5>VERA.</h5> 
<p>[7]It is night, indeed, brother! Night without moon or star![7]
    Russia is smitten to the heart! The man Ivan whom men call the Czar
    strikes now at our mother with a dagger deadlier than ever forged by
    tyranny against a people's life!</p>
